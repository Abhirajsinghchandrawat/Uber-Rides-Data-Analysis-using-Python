# Uber Rides Data Analysis using Python

## Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Uber rides data using Python. It aims to uncover insights into ride patterns, popular locations, and trip durations while leveraging data visualization techniques.

## Features
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of ride patterns and trends
- Analysis of trip duration, distance, and frequency
- Insights into peak hours and popular pickup/dropoff locations

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Geopy
- Folium

## Dataset
The dataset contains Uber ride records, including details such as:
- Pickup and dropoff locations
- Trip duration
- Date and time of rides
- Trip distance

## Installation
